# NestJS Prompt Managing Application

## Introduction
This project is a prompt management application built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. The application uses Redis to handle CRUD operations, ensuring fast data processing and retrieval. For ease of deployment and development, the application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Key Features
- **Efficient CRUD Operations**: Utilizes Redis for fast and efficient data handling.
- **Containerized Development**: Docker and Docker Compose for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with NestJS, offering a structured framework for server-side applications.

## Technologies
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **Docker**: A set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
